# How to use?
## Requirements

The following versions have been tested. But newer versions should also be fine. 

- Cplex 12.9
- python 3.6
- Matlab_R2017b


## Data Prepareation

Run "main_generate.m".

## Run

Run the main programm.

```
python main_train.py
```

## Notes

This repository contains the code for "cut-classifier". The code for "cut-regressor" is similar and one can reproduce it by himself/herself.
